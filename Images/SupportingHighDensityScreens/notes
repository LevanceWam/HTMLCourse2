This is the notes for SupportingHighDensityScreens

these days we have a lot of high density screens with more pixels 
and this is something that we need to take into account when we display images 

over the years we've had different models of iphones with similiar screen sizes but 
double the pixels/resolution

with the iphone 4 this was the first generation called retina display
so if we have a image that is 320 x 320
on a iphone 3 it will fit
on the iphone 4 has a scale factor of 2x which means its going to render each 
pixel of the image using 2 pixels on the device 
so its going to resize the image and make it twice as big

Here's the problem with that 
remember when we scale up a raster image the image can look a little bit blurry 
if we want to make the image look a nicer on high density screens we are
going to have to provide a seperate version of 
of the image that is twice as big as the original
we will look into this in a little bit 

##terms 
here are some terms we need to look into:
our devices these days have a few properties 
    - Physical resolution
        * this is based on the actual number of pixels on the device 
   
    - Logical resolution
        * this is how they behave basically

        so iphone 4 has a Logical resolution of 480 x 320
        css is always based on the Logical resolution
        so when we say 200px in css we are talking about Logical resolution

    - Device pixel ratio (DPR)
        * this is the ratio of physical to Logical pixels 
        different screens have different DPRs
        sometimes it can be 1 and a half it can be 2 or 2 and a half 
        and so on 

    - high density
        * this is essentially a screen with a DPR greater than one 
        which means we have more physical px than logical px

now we are going to go into photoshop and learn how to make these images bigger 
if we do not have photoshop we can use something else but the 
folder of images we have include the larger images 

notice the 2x and 3x at the end of the file name 
this is the proper naming convention 

##In photoshop or similar tools 
click on the image tab and hit image size 

next we are going to set the image width to 1200 and the height to the same thing 
so for screens this is 3x the size of 400px screens 

then we need to go and save the image 
we are going to save it as a jpg and we get a dialog box 
to let us compress the image 
as a rule of thumb for jpg is 7 becasue we get a good quality and compression
then we do the dame for 2x screens so it is going to be 800

**note**
it is best to start with the biggest image  in this case 3x 
because if we go the other way around we are going to get a blurry image 
because PS has to create new pixels 


##srcset
to provide different versions of the same image for high density screens 
we're going to use the source set attribute

this attribute we can provide a set of sources for different 
screens 

we should not try to use this image everywhere the best place to do this is on a homepage with images that need to be super sharp
this technique is also for fixed sized images
