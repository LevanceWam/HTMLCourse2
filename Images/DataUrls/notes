This is the notes for DataUrls

time to take a look at data urls 
formerly called data URI's
this is another optimization technique to reduce the number of http request 

with this technique we can embed a image directly into a html 
document or a stylesheet

so for this lecture we need to go to https://cssportal.com/image-to-data/
if the site goes down just do a simple google search

so we can drop an image in the box
then in the data uri box we get a sequence of characters and 
we can insert this into a html doc or a stylesheet

this url starts with data
this is another url protocol like https and http 
this is used for representing a binary file in a sequence of characters

now if we open the browser we are going tose the image 
then we can look in devtools and in the network tab
we are getting s data url this data url is coming from the memory 
because it is embedded in the document 

##problems 
1. size of the embedded code > size of the resource 
    *the embedded code will always be larger than the original 
    we do not want to embed so many images using DataUrls because we will end up increasing the size of the html doc 
    or stylesheet

2. increased complexity added to the markup and workflow 

3. slow on mobile
