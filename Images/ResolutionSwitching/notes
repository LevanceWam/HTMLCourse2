This is the notes for ResolutionSwitching

sometimes we are going to want to provide different 
images for mobile, tablets, and laptops

this is called the ResolutionSwitching problem 
lets tackle this scenario

so working off of the last lecture 
we notice that we set the width too 400px
and provide 3 different versions for standard and high density screens 

standard and high density screens have different resolutions 
now if the image was going to be displayed at exactly the same size across 
these devices this wouldn't be a problem

but if we changed it to a relative unit then we have a problem 
because of the current implementation we are going to supply the same image to all the device we saw in the 
previous slide 

so we are going to get the same image on each device 
which is 800x800

now the browser on each device has to resize the image 
so it takes up 100% of the width of the viewport

this resizing operation can be costly to the browser 
the larger this image the more costly this operation is going to be 
because the browser has to load the entire image in the memory in order to resize it 
this is the resolution switching problem

## fixing the problem
so in html instead of providing 1x and etc we are going to 
provide the width of the image like 400w 

the w unit is used to represent the actual width of the image
so at this point we do not care about the physical or logical resolution of the screen
we are telling the browser we have this image with this width

now the browser will pick the correct image based on the resolution and pixel ratio of the screen 
but we can take this to the next level 

lets say on mobile we want the image to take up the entire width of the page 
on a tablet half of the page and on the desktop a 3rd of the page 
we are going to implent this without using media queries 
this is because the width that we apply to a image impact the browsers decision to pick the right file 

##sizes attribute 
so we need to get rid of the rule on meal in css 

next we are going to add the sizes attribute to the image element 
so we are going to use media conditions to help us use the correct image for each size

##picking a size 
The image size that we used In this lecture was arbitrary so we do not need to always use the sizes shown in this demo
instead we can go to :
https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/ 

this can help us decide on the sizes and generate image assets

we can upload a file here and it will generate our image assets according to the settings on the page we set
