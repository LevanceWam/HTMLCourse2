This is the notes for ContentImages

in html we have 2 kinds of images 
    - content images 
    - BackgroundImages

lets take a look at content images in this lecture 

## Img element
in previous lectures we took a look at the image element 
make sure to go back and look over the basic
    - what the attributes are used for

there are times we are going to just have images just for 
decoration and in this case we can have the alt attribute blank 
this is because the screen readers will read out the name of the file 
if the alt attribute is not there 

we do not want the screen reader to do this 
so as a best pratice leave the alt attribute blank 

now using the meal image if we look in the browser 
we have a 400 x 400 px image 

this is the real size of the image 

## scaling images 
we can always use css to scale a image 

as an example we are going to sett the img width to 100% of the viewport
this makes our image look blurry 
we loss some of the details because the image was originally 
400 x 400 px but since we are showing it at a much bigger size and we don't have
enough px or dat about those details 
this is why it looks blurry this is the problem with raster images 

SVG files do not have this problem
but we can not show this meal using mathematics is really complex 
in reality this is never going to be possible
