This is the notes for CSSSprites

We are going to look at a optimization technique called 
CSS Sprites

so we are going to use somes image that we got from 
https://www.flaticon.com/

now if we use the devtools and look on the network tab and disable the cache 
when we refresh the page we want to make sure the images are redownloaded

notice that to get the images the browser has to send seperate http request to the browser 
now if the page has a million images and we have a million users
all of the users are going to send millions of request to the server 
this is going to cost a lot of overhead on the server 

this is where the CSSSprites technique comes in

##CSSSprites technique

this allows us to combine all of the images into a single image
then we get that image using a single http request

First thing we need to do is to go to this website:
http://cssspritestool.com/

this site makes it easy for us to combine multiple images 
there are plenty sites that can do this as a one off but
it would be better to use the command line if we need to make multiple sprites 
because with the command line we can automate the process
this is beyond the scope of this lecture 

back to http://cssspritestool.com/ 
we are going to add the images we are going to use in this lecture 
then we have some setting that we can set for this lecture everything will remain the same 
except that the css class prefix will be 'bg-'

now all we need to do is download the zip and 
open it

in this file we are going to find the images that combine together and some other things
there is a css file that is include and we are going to check that out 

this file has a bunch of generated classes and they all start with 'bg-'
after the bg- there is a name of one of the images that was combined 

looking at the properties we can see that there is a Background property that has the 
url value of our combine image
after that we have 2 value for the Background position

so we are going to copy the rules from the css into our css and 
in the html we are going to add on of the classes to a span element 

now if we take a look at the rule again we can see that we set the width, height, and changed the 
displat to inline-block 

**Remember**
inline element can not have width and heights applied to them 
unless we change the display to inline-block 

now we can add the other images to the page 
now the cool thing about this is that now the browser is only making one http request

##problem 
we need to be careful when using this technique
we shouldn't try to add all the images  we have into a css sprite 
because: 

    - File size can get too large
    - sprites are not flexible 
        ** if we wanted to replace one of these images we have 
        to regenerate the css sprite so we should use this approach
        for small logos and icons
