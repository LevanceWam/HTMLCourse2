This is the notes for FontIcons

There is another way for displaying icons 
we can use something called icon fonts 
this are special fonts 

some of the most popular font icons are:
    - FontAwesome
    - Ionicons
    - Material design icons 

those are the most popular ones 
on this lecture we are going to see how to use FontAwesome

first we need to go to https://fontawesome.com/
they have a free plan and a pro plan 

so we need to hit start and create a kit package 
and configure the setting to the project 

then when we are ready to use we need to save the changes and then 
at the top go to how to use and copy the script element and place it in th head section
of our html

now that we added the script tag we can add one or more icons 

now we are going to use a icon 
then change the color and size of it
