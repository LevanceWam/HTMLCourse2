This is the notes for Image Types and Formats

lets look into image types and formats 
in computers we have 2 types of images 

* raster
    these images are made up of pixels 
    raster images are used for photos 

* vector 
    which are defined by a set of mathematical vectors like lines 
    and curves
    vector images are used for simple graphics, icon, logos etc

##Raster
    - comes from cameras and scanners and they can be produced by software 
    - formats: jpg, png, gif, etc
    - more pixels = larger images 
        * on the web we do not want to serve large images this can take a long time to download
    - looks blurry if scaled up
        * so we don't want to serve up small images 
    
##vector
    - created in software (illustrator)
    - format: SVG
    - Scalable Vector Graphics
    - look sharp at any size 
        *this is because they are not made of pixels 

##Raster Image formats 
here are some of the common ones 
    - jpg
    - gif
    - png
    - webp
        * this is a modern image format a lot of people are not familiar with 
        they are commonly short in size, but webp is not supported in internet explorer
