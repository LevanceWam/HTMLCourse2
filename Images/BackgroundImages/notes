This is the notes for BackgroundImages

we often use background images for decorative purposes 
we can apply a background to the body or a section and so on 

lets try to make a rule for the body and give it a background image

##backgroundImage 
using the background/background-image property we can add a url function to add the background image 
now we can see that the image is repeated this is ugly

##background-repeat 
using this property we can disable the horizontal and vertical repetitions 
or we can set it to repeat along the horizontal or vertical axis

##background-position
by default the image is moved into the top left corner of the element 
but we have full control on where this image can be using this property

this property takes 2 values one for the horizontal and the vertical
postive to the right and down 
negative for left and up
these values depend on the image 

we can also use relative units by using 100% the image will go all the way to the right of the container 

##background-size
this property allows us to change the size of the image 
again we need to enter in 2 values 
for the width and the height 

we can also use relative units here 
don't forget that since the body element is a block-level element 
the height is 0 by default it will get tall enough to cover its content 

###cover value 

we can aslo use the value cover for the background-size property
this resizes the background so it covers the entire container while keeping its aspect ratio
so in this case it covers the entire page 

if we pay close attention the background image looks a little blurry 
because the image is really small

but we can use the same image but larger 
using bg-paper@2x

##background-attachment
now we are going to switch to another background image then we are going to add a heading to the page 
then we are going to increase the height of the body so we can scroll

now the image has grown larger so the image is trying to cover the page
but we are not going to worry about this at the moment 

notice that when we scroll the image moves with us
to stop this we use this property and give it a value of fix
now the content is the only thing tht is moving 
and the image is smaller

this is beacuse it is set to 100% of the viewport and not 300vh
