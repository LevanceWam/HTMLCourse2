This is the notes for ScalableVectorGraphics

Lets take a look into ScalableVectorGraphics
these graphics are defined by mathematical vectors
like lines, curves and etc 

they are not tied to pixels and look sharp at any size
we can change the size and they will still come out looking nice 

we use svg files for logos icons and simple graphics 
another application is in backgrounds 

##svg backgrounds
so if we head to https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/

we can find plenty of backgrounds and preview them 
they all look really sharp because they are defined by math and not pixels 

so lets try this using a file that wwe have 

svg files are really powerful and really small
