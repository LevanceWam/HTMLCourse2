this is the notes for UsingModernImageFormats

earlier in the section we took a look at the common raster image formats 
we are going to take a look at how to use these modern image formats 
for this lesson we are going to use webp

##converting to webp
to convert to webp here are some options:
    - photoshop (webpshop plug-in)
    - sketch 
    - online tools (https://cloudconvert.com/)
    - command-line tools 

we are going to use https://cloudconvert.com/
we upload an image and select the format that we want to use
remember that webp is a lot smaller than jpg

##using webp
there are 2 ways to use this image

    1. we can use the image element 
    but the problem with this is internet explorer does not support webp

    2.we can use the picture element 
    this is so we can use webp

##picture element 
each picture can have multiple sources 

if the browser doesn't support webp it will go to jpg

we should always include a img element just incase the browser does not support the picture element
