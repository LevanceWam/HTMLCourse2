this is the notes for Filters

In css we can also apply filters to our images 
some of these filters include:
    - grayscale
    - blur 
    - contrast
    - brightness
    - saturate 
    - and more 

staeting with grayscale we have a css function for this 
we can add a value here

we can also apply multiple filters here 
so now we are going to add blur 

#Question:
    what if we wanted to add these filters after we hover over the image 
    ans:
        remember psuedo class selectors?
        with this we can choose a element with a particular class or particular state 

so we are going to add the hover psuedo class selector
