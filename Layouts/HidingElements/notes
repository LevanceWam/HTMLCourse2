This is the notes for HidingElements

Lets learn how to hide elements
we are going to use 2 paragraph elements 

now we are going to hid e the first one
we are going to give it a special class 
or use a pseudo class selector

now lets go define some rules 
we have 2 properties for hiding a element 
**it is important for us to understand the differences 

## Using display property
the one that we use most of the time is display 
we can set its value to none and the paragraph disappears

## visibility property
In contrast we can use the visibility property
the default value is visible, but we can set this to hidden
noticed that when we use the property the item is gone but the 
space allocated for the paragraph is still there 

this is why the second paragraph is appearing so far down 

##In short
The display hidden method hides the element like it was never there 
but the visibility property will just have the element hidden
the space allocated will still be there
