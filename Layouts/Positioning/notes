This is the notes for Positioning

Going forward we are going to talk about various techniques to position elements 
and creating layouts

in this lecture we are going to look at 
presizing and Positioning elements on the screen

so we are going to start with a parent div with 3 divs as child elements

*note:
    each element can have multiple classes we seperate them by space 

    now we have a box that has 3 different boxes with different colors 

    now in this lesson we are using abstract boxes
    but in a real scenario these boxes can be anything
    images, headings, paragraphs
    this is Irrelevant we are just worried about positioning 

now lets say we want to take the second box and position it a little to the right 
this is where we would use the position property

##position property
now by default the position of all elements is static
this means they are not positioned they appear in their normal position 

so the first thing we should do is set the property to relative
so we can position this element relative of its normal position
now we can use the properties:
    - top
    - left
    - right 
    - bottom to move the element around

so we are going to add 5rem of space to the left of the 2nd box
we can aslo use negative values here too

this is a popular technique for elements that are intially off the screen
then using some fancy animations they pop into existence

now just because we are using a rem unit here does not mean we need to always use it 
the unit we use depends on what we are building 
sometimes pixels makes sense other times % and so on
right is just like setting the left property to negative 

we also have top and bottom
we can add spaces to these too

now something that we need to notice here is that box one and 3 are still in the same position
they are not affected by us moving around box 3

also notice that we have overlapping 
box 2 is appearing to be on top of box1 
because it comes last in the dom

this can be changed by moving the stacking order of the elements 

##z-index
by setting the z-index (zed-index) property to a positive or negative value to move the box 
along the zed axis

on webpages we have 3 axis:
    - horizontal axis (x-axis)
    - vertical axis (y axis)
    - zed axis(z-axis)
        * this axis represents the depth

think of it like a line that comes from the screen towards your eyes 
by default the zed index of all properties is 0
if we set it to a positive value like one it comes closer to us
if we set it to a negative value it will move away from us 

The higher or lower the number on the Z axis
The higher or lower The element will move up or down to axis

##absolute positioning
This is contrast to relative positioning
with absolute positioning we can position a element 
relative to its container 

***so first we need to set the position of the container to 
relative this is very important***

next in the box-one we are going to 
set the position to absolute set the trbl values that we are using to 0

now box one is positioned relative to its container 
notice that box 3 moved up because we are absolute postioning the yellow box

this is happening because when we absolute position an element
that element is removed from the normal flow of the page 

so from the parents element's point of view that element does not exist 
imagine that it is on a seperate layer

so this container only sees the other 2 boxes

##fixed positioning
now sometimes we are going to want to set a element relative to the viewport
for example 
    A navbar that always stays on the top

so now we should set the position property to fix 
we will do this to box 3

now we can see that the box is out of the container because it 
is position relative to the viewport
which is the visible area of the browser
this means that the box is going to stay at the top of the page always 

to test this we are going to set the height of the 
body element to 200vh (200% of the viewport)

##
there are 2 ways to set the size of position elements 
one way is to set the width and the height properties
which we have been doing up this point 

another way is to use the combination of left/right and top/bottom 

##Recap
Postitining 
    - relative: relative to the elements normal position other elements are not affected
    - absolute: position a element relative to the parent element
    - fixed: position a element relative to the viewport
