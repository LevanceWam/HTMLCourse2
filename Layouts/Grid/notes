This is the notes for Grid

So we saw that flexbox makes it easier for us 
to lay out content in a row or a column.

but there are going to be times where we need to layout 
content in both rows and columns 
this is where we would use grids

##grids
laying out content in both rows and columns 
a common application for creating grids is in photo galleries 

another example is the layout for most websites 

##defining a grid
lets see how we define a grid 

to define a grid we are going to need a container first 
in the container we are going to set the display property to grid
then we are going to use these 2 properties
    - grid-template-rows
    - grid-template-columns
to define the number and size of rows and columns 

do all together this:
    - display: Grid
    - grid-template-rows
    - grid-template-columns

##getting started
so we are going to make a div with the class of container 
then define some styles 

so we make a rule and set display to grid
now lets attempt to have a grid set up of 3 x 2

##grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns
this property will set the size and number of rows/columns 

so since we want 3 rows we are going to set the size of the rows to be 100px tall for each row
then for 2 column we do the same 

now if we look inside of the browser and open up devtools 
in the DOM we can see that our container has a grid badge 
if we do not see this we are using a older version of devtools 

if we click the grid badge we can toggle the grid display 
now in the devtools if we click layout tab
in this tab we can set the options for this grid 

we can show the number of lines, track sizes (size of grid),
and at the bottom we can see all of the grids we have on the page 
this is useful if we have multiple grids and we can change the colors if we need to 

##repeat function
so remember we do not want duplication in the code 
so we decided we want to change the size of the columns
there are 2 places that need to be modified 

a better approach is to use the repeat function 
so for the value of the column or row call this function 
and insert the number and the size of the column/rows
this gives us a single place to modify the code if we need to 

##grid-template 
this is a shorthand property for grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns

the first agrument is for the row
we then seperate with a '/'
next is the column 

now we are going to add items to the grid 
for this demo we are going to use some boxes
