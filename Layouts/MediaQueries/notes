this is the notes for MediaQueries

##MediaQueries
with media queries we can provide different styles for 
different devices depending on their features 
such as screen size, orientation, and etc

with this we can build webpages that look awesome 
on mobile devices, tablets annd desktop computers we call this a 
responsive website 

##responsive Design
they are called responsive websites because they respond to various screen
sizes

to build a responsive website we need two approaches
    - build desktop first
        * later we would adjust the layout for tables 
        and mobile later 

    - build mobile first
        * then adjust the layout for tablets and desktops 
        majority of the community favors mobile first

        *this is because its much easier to build a simple web page for mobile and then 
        if we have extra space we can add in extra stuff 

so if we decided to do desktop first and we make a complex site 
we might have to squeeze a lot of things. so the images look good on mobile
its doable but not recommended

##building a site using media queries 
we are going to look at building the sites shown in the screenshots 

we are going to make a container with 2 divs inside with paragraph elements 
inside of that 

we are going to use flex on the container div
    * remember that flex direction is set to row by default 
    so we are going to have to set the direction to column for mobile 

then we are going to have to use media queries to see if the screen is wider than lets say 500px
then we are going to set flex to row so the items will appear next to eachother 

##styles 
in the css we are going to define some styles 
after we apply some we are going to see we have 

so far the 2 divs are stacked on each other

now on devtools we are going to click the device simulation
we can also pick the type of device we want to emulate 
we can also rotate the screen

##breakpoints 
so if we resize the browser window and make it really small 
as we start to increase the size the at some point our design is going to break
we should aim for this moment to add our breakpoint 

* A breakpoint is the point at which our design breaks down

we are going to use media queries to write specific stats for 
devices that are wider than our breakpoint 

in devtools if we resize the window we can see the current size of the viewport 
so at 629px we are going to want to put the boxes next to each other 
lets go implement this 

##media query implementation 
so first we start with the '@media' rule'
then we type the query

A query can have multiple parts si with each part 
we're asking somethoing about the target device 

the first part is the type of the device  which can be 
    - screen (web browsers)
    - print (this targets printers)
for this we are going with screen we will talk about print later 

Second part of the query,
we need to use the "and" operator and in parenthesis 
we type a condition we want to see of the screen is wider than 600px
so we say min-width 600px

so if this query is true then the size of it defined inside of the curly braces
will be applied otherwise they are going to be ignored
inside of these braces we are overidding the rules we applied to the page 

one of the mistake a lot of people make is that they find tables on the internet where they can find common 
breakpoints. the problem with this is that these numbers are based on the current devices that are out 
if a new device with 5 or 10 pixels wider or narriiow we are going to have to have to 
adjust the design for each release and we do not want to do that 

the numbers for our breakpoint should depend on the design 
do not blindly pick break points 

we can extend our current query to find the max

now we are going to add another break point for 900px 
now if the screen is wider than 900 we will get a different look

so the changes we apply are dependant on our design and how it should look 
across different devices there is no right or wrong


##MediaQueries print 
we can aslo apply media queries that will apply to printers 

##end

so using media queries we can query certian properties of a device 
like its type, its width, and so on 
and provide styles that will only apply if 
those properties are meet
