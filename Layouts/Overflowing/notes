this is the notes for Overflowing

## Overflow concept
A concept we need to know when dealing with fixed size elements is that 
sometimes Overflow might happen.

so lets say we have a container with a fixed size 
and we have to muxh content in the container
the container is not fitting the entire content 

this is when overflow happens 

so we are going to make a div to help us out with this 
inside this div we are going to have a paragraph element with 50 words and 
we will see overflow in action
we can see that the text is going outside of the container 

w can use the overflow property to control how overflow
should behave 

##overflow property
if we set the overflow property to its default visible
this is what we are currently seeing the text going out of the container 

###hidden
now if we set it to hidden the extra content will be hidden 

###scroll
another value we can use is scroll 
we will get 2 scroll bars a horiziontal and a vertical bar 

###auto
by using this value the scroll bars will only appear if overflow happens 

*important
the overflow property is a shorthand for 2 other properties 
overflow-x and overflow-y
if we supply a single value it will be applied to both

sometimes we are going to want to have more control over the overflow so for this 
example we are going to place the x value to hidden now we are not going to 
have a horizontal scroll
