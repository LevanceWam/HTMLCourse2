this is the notes for FloatingElements

floating elements is another technique for 
Positioning elements and creating layouts

so lets say we want to display a tweet.
we can use the article element to represent this 

inside of this article we are going to have some text 
and a div with a class of avatar that will represent a image

remember that paragraph elements are block-level elements
so this is going to show up on a new line 

##Float Property
now we are going to move the paragraph element next to the 
div using float Property
in css in the avatar rule we are going to set the float property to left

this is going to float the avatar element to the left of the container
all of the other elements will flow around this. we can also float them to the right 

now if we add another paragraph
with longer text it will flow around the image also
this is how floats work

now we are going to add a right margin in the avatar to give it a little bit of space
we could have added it to the paragraph but we already have a rule for avatar so it makes more 
sense to add it to the avatar rule 

*notes
    we are using relative units (rem) so if the text size changes 
    the space and width will also adjust accordingly

Now if we look at the page we can see that the second paragraph element is 
floating around the div and there are going to be 
situations where we do not want that to happen 

so how can we fix this?

##clear property
this is where we would use the clear property
so we are going ti make a new class called clear

we are going to add the clear property and set its value to left because 
the div element is floating to the left if it was floating to the 
right we would set this to the right 

but, there is another value 'both' so if we have elements that are floated to the 
left or the right this will clear all of those floats
this is actually more preferred by most people to set this to both
so we don't have to remember the direction of floats 

so now we set this class to the second element and now it is appearing under the div

###float issues
there is a problem with floats called parent collapsing 
which means parent elements don't see floated elements when they collapse

see we are going to add a border to the article and comment out the second paragraph 
Now we see that the parent element (article) has collapsed now it only contains the 
paragraph element and not the div

this is because the div is the floated element 
and by default parent elements do not see floated elements
they are invisible to them 

so the article increased enough to cover the paragraph elememt
if we get rid of it, it'll collapse futher 

###solutions 
1. The first way to solve this problem is to add a empty div with the class of clear to the
bottom of the container to clear the float
    - so whenever we use float we have to use clear after
    or we can run into weird layout issues

    - But there is a problem this div the empty container is not meaning full
    to search engines or screen readers 
    this makes our html unsemantic this is a problem 

2. The other way to deal with this is to use sudo elements we can use the before and after sudo elements 
so we can create a rule targeting the tweet class and adding the sudoelement to it
    - with this approach we are dynamically adding a div instead of directly adding it to the code 

    - but this isn't ideal for if we have to use this rule in multiple places
    because then we have to duplicate it 

3. The best way is to take step 2 and make it a general class that can be applied anywhere 
making it more reusable 

    - a common name for this is called clearfix
    (do not abbrevate this can cause confusion)

    -now all we have to do is add a second class to the 
    article and we solve the float issue

4. we can use the overflow property
    - but depending on the value provided this can cause more issues 
    such as clipping the content, scrollbars where we dont want them 

    this is not the best way to solve this 
    this is something some people would call a hack 
    a dirty solution.


**takeaway
floats are a little difficult to work with 
we have to deal with parent collapsing, we have to clear floats out 
this is why we shouldn't use floats to build layouts 

floats where used in the pass when we didnt have flexbox and grid
so use those too for your layouts 

there are still plenty of sites that use floats so this is why we took a look into them
