This is the notes for BoxModel

##Box model concept
One of the very important concepts in CSS is the
the concept of Box model 

This means that whenever the browser renders a element 
it places that element in a invisible box.

##Structure 
at the core of the box we have the content area
    - this is where the content is displayed 

following that we have padding 
    - this is used for adding space out side of the content area

next is the border area
    - if we have a border it is shown after these too

finally we have margin area
    - this is used to add space between different elements 

this is what we call the BoxModel
now to see them in action 

first we are going To create a paragraph element and using dev tools
if we hover over the element we see the box BoxModel

the blue area is the content area and the orange is the margin area 
the padding and border are going to be added in a second

now we are going to use css to control the size of these areas

*Clarifing the padding and the margin property

a lot of people do not know how to use padding and margin properly
and this is why a lot of issues occur in their layouts 
so lets tackle this issue once and for all.

we are going to duplicate the paragraph element so we can see this in action

##padding
if we hover over the first paragraph element we can see the padding area
below the content area we can see that we have 20px of padding on the bottom
on the second we have 20px on the top 

so what is the actual space between these 2 elements?
 - its 20px + 20px which is 40px all together 
 
##Margin collapsing
now if we change the padding to zero and margin to 20px
we can Immediately see that the elements are closer 

this is what we call margin collapsing 
if we have 2 elements that are close to each other 
their margins get collapse into a single margin.

if we were to hover over the elements with dev tools on we can see that 
the margin collapsed or combined with each other 

so technically we should be using the margin element to seperate elements 
and the padding property to addspace between the border and the content area of a element
