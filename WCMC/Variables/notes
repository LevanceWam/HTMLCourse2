This is the notes for Variables

we are going to look into css variables 

css variables are also known as custom properties to 
keep our code DRY

so we created 2 divs with classes and set them to the same color 
this is a very common problem in a lot of stylesheets 

this is where we can use css variables to get rid of duplications 

at the top of the stylesheet we use the root psuedo class selector

##:root selector
this selector matches the html element  
this is where we can define custom properties or global variables 

the property should start with '--' 
we can store anything in these properties 

all of these properties can be inherited by the DOM
