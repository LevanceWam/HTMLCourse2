This is the notes for Object-orientedCSS

Do we remember that OOP is a set of principles for creating reusable components.
we have the same concept in CSS, we can structure our styles and make them usable 
if we reuse our styles we dont have to repeat them over and over 

Object Oriented CSS is based on 2 very simple principles 
    * Seperate container from content

        for this we are going to create a banner in the hero section 

        # now what if we wanted to create the same button in another section 
        like a sidebar but we notice that the buttin does not inherit the styles one way to solve is to duplicate the 
        hero properties and change the name of the target class'
        but this makes our code messy

        this is where this principle comes into play
        this is where we need to seperate the container from the content

        in this example btn is the content and hero or side-bar are the container 
        we are going to want to seperate the content from the container
        so we just remove the parent element 

        now where ever we put the button it is always going to look the same 

    * Seperate structure and skin 

        now lets say we wanted to make the sidebar button blue 
        instead of duplicating it we can use the second principle 

        the second principle says we want to seperate the skin from the structure 
        so we are going to want to have a button class that purely defines the structure 
        so we would remove the background color property from 
        the .btn class  then make another class to define the color of the skin
