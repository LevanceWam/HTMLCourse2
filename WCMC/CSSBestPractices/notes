This is the notes for CSSBestPractices

we are going to look at 8 techniques to help us write cleaner 
and more maintainable CSS. 

    - Following a name convention consistly
        * we can use something called kebab case: where we 
        seperate the words using a hyphen
        * camelcase
        * pascal
        * underscore
    the point in this is that we need to stick to one of these and 
    define a guildline for the team to foolow

    - Create logical sections in the stylesheet
        * for larger projects we are going to want to 
        split a stylesheet into multiple stylesheet and combine them together
        this is where CSS preprocessor tools like SASS and LESS come in 

        * for a small project we do not want to write all the styles in one place we are going to 
        want to seperate them in different containers
        so we would break up the stylesheet into sections and write rules for just those sections 
        like for typography, colors, basic styles 

    - Avoid over-specific selectors
        * this is a common problem 
        * we do not want to make rules for overspecified selectors 
        this is going to be hard to keep track and maintain 

    - Avoid the !important keyword 
        * avoid this as much as possible 
        * using it could mean that we have a overly specificed selector somewhere 

    - Sort CSS properties 
        * this isn't super important but could help make things look a little nicer 
        * hit command shift p and type in sort to do this easily 

    - Take advantage of style inheritance 

    - Extract repetitive patterns in the stylesheet
        * this is apart of object oriented CSS we will look into this later 

    - Avoid repitive values (Keep it DRY)
