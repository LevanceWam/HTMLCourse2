This is the notes for BEM

BEM is a popular naming convention which is short for 
Block element modifier

the idea of BEM is to think of our webpage ad a bunch of blocks or components or modules 
these blocks contains elements and they can be modified 

we are going to use the BEM naming convention for naming classes for the blocks 

these blocks can be reused and modified to our liking
so if we create a bunch of cards we can modify certian ones 
we use a modifier to modify the blocks 

modifiers are written like this card--color
blocks are card__color
