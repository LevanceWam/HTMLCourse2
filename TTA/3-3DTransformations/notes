This is the notes for 3-3DTransformations

now we are going to be looking into 3d transformations 

in the last demo we saw we can move our box along the x and y access
but we can also move it along the z axis 
and the z axis is a line that comes from the screen towards our eyes

##transform property
so we are going to use the transform property again 

###translateZ
so this time we are going to look at translate z 
if we pass a positive value the box will move closer to us 

now nothing is going to happen right away because we didn't 
set the perspective

###perspective
this function needs to go before we call our function so we can define a virtual space 
so this space gives us a distance between us and the element 

###3d rotating
by default when we use rotate we are rotating on the z axis 
but if we where to use:
    - rotateX
    - rotateY 
we will see a 3d transformation

**Question:
    Where is the origin of the rotation?
    ans:
        From the center of the element 

we can move the origin of the rotation by using 
transform-origin property

##multiple transformations
lets say we want to transform multiple elements
we would have to wrap them in a container
