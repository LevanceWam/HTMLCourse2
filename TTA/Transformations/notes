This is the notes for Transformations

Now we are going to take a look at Transformations
in css we have a bunch of functions for transforming elements
such as:
    - rotate()
    - scale()
    - skew()
    - translate()

We are going to apply our transformations to the hover affect so 
we can see them clearly

##transform property
    * rotate function
        so we are going to add this property and add the rotate function
        we are going to rotate it 15deg clockwise
        if we set it to negative it will go counter clockwise

    * scale function   
        this function is going to make our box smaller or bigger 

    * skew function 
        this function is going to make the box skew to the left or the right 

    * translate function 
        this function is going to move the box on the screen  along the horizontal and vertical axis 

now we might be wondering why use the translate function when we have absolute and relative positioning 
there are 2 reasons for this 
    1. it is easier to position elements using the translate function
    2. this function uses hardware acceleration we get better performance when moving a element 
    as a animation 

also we can combine the functions in the transform property
but it is very important to know that the order of these functions is important because they all have different results
