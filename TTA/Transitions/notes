This is the notes for Transitions

as we may have notice that our transitions happen so fast and 
suddenly we should fix that 

##transition property
we can use the transition property to animate one or more properties 

notice that we are applying this property to the box itself
and not the hover state with the Transformation

so we are going to animate the transform property 
because this is the property we are updating when we are hovering over the box

now optionally we can supply a timing function 
the default function is linear 
this means that the animation is going progress at a linear rate 

but we also have:
    - ease-in
        * this animation starts slowly and then progresses
        quiclky
    - ease-out
        * the opposite of ease-in starts quick and ends slow 
    - cubic-bezier
        * this is a custom curve specified by us 
        we can go to: https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67
        we can create a custom cubic-bezier curve easily


##delays
optionally we can supply a delay so the animation can start a second or so after 
we hover over the box

##animating multiple properties
so lets say we want to change the color of the back ground of our box
