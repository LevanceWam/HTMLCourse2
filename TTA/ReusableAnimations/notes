This is the notes for ReusableAnimations

in the last lecture we learned how to use the animate property

Now what if we wanted to add the same animation to another element
we don't want to repeat the same properties for different elements

so lets look into creating reusable animations 

so first we are going to create a class 
then move all of the properties that have to deal with animation into this class
now if we have a element we need to animate all we have to do is add the class to the element
in the html

Now here is something cool:
if we go to https://animate.style/
we can find a bunch of beautiful and reusable animations

to use this all we need to do is get the style sheet and use their classes in our markup

next to start using the animations we need to add to class
one for the general use for all of the animations and the second class determines the kind of animation
