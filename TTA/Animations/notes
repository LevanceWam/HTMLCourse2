this is the notes for Animations

in the last lecture we looked at using transitions for simple animations 
but for the more complex animations we need to use the animate property

##animate property
first we are going to want to define a bunch of key frames 
our css animations can have several frames 

so we need to use the @keyframes rule 
to define a bunch of keyframes
next we type a name for the animation
we want to create 

for each keyframe we specify a percentage of the time
through the animation sequence
