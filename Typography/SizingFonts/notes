This is the notes for SizingFonts

remember using the font size property
we can change the size of our font 
we can use absolute or relative units 

Now as a general rule of thumb we should forget about 
pixels for setting the font size because pixels are not consisten
across devices 

we call this retina display technology 
so we can not rely on pixels as a consistent form 
of measurement across devices
because 20px for windows might be fine but on a mac the text might look smaller 
this is the problem with pixels 

this is where we would want to use relative units 
generally speaking the best unit to use is the rem unit 
so we are going to set the font size to 1 rem in the body 

by using relative units we can make our font responsive with very little code 
this will help our text look great on various screen sizes

we are going to do a mobile approach to change the font size of the width and 
then set up a media query for anything bigger than 400px

Question:
    How big should our headings be?
    ans:
        if we go to https://type-scale.com/
        we can see a visualization of various sizes this can help us find the right 
        font size for different headings

this is a very powerful tool and we should try to use this
