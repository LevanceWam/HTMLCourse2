this is the notes for SystemFontStack

##SystemFontStack
this is another concept that we need to know about 
with this stack we can tell the browser 
to use the default font of the operating system on the users  computer 
here are some benefits of using this:
    - can boost performance (saves us time from downloading fonts)
    - no (FOUT) 
    - native look (look familiar to the user)
    - overall better experience 

but there are problems with this approach
    - default fonts vary 
        (different os different default fonts)

so when we use the system font stack the font will look different 
from one computer to another 

*Question:
    How are system fonts different from wed safe fonts
    ans:
        - web safe fonts are the basic elementary fonts 
        that have been around for almost 20 years and are available on every computer 
        they are kind of boring 
        - system fonts are more modern fonts that are used by todays 
        os' so they look much better 

    so to do this in your css all you have to do in vscode 
    is type -apple and this will generate the default fonts for 
    all of the operating systems
