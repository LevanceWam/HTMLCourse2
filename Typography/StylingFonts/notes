This is the notes for StylingFonts

we are going to learn about StylingFonts
so we are going to use a header and a paragraph element for this example 
in the stylesheet we are going to define some rules

## font family
This is the first property we are going to be looking at 
with this we can change the font of this element 

Generally speaking we have 3 main catergories:
    - serif
    - sans serif
    - Monospace

there are more catergories but those catergories are mostly used in printing
and they are irrelevant for the web

* What are the differences?
    ans:
        - Serif fonts have a small line or stroke at the end of all the characters
        they are more professional and more serious. 
        often used in books, newspapers and magazines
            - georgia and times new roman are an example of this catergory

        - Sans-serif do not have these lines or strokes at the end of characters
        they are a little more playful and modern 
        some examples of these are 
            - avenir
            - arial
            - futura
            - helvectica
            - roboto
        
        - monospace, mono means one so this means one space
        these fonts are a little different from the fonts in other catergories
        in the sense that the width of the characters is exactly the same 
        this is why these fonts are ideal for displaying code 
            - consolas
            - courier
            - unbuntu
        this is ideal because we want the characters to align in our code 

**tip**
by pressing ctrl and space vs code will give you suggestions 
this will pull up the [web safe fonts] that is common on most computers

after that we can pick a [font stack]
a font stack consist of multiple fonts 
if the first font is not available on the computer it will go to the next font 
in the stack

the last font in the stack is a generic font 
the font that will be used here will vary from computer to computer 

now if we add a anchor element and  we will see that the font is different 
we want to make the anchor element the same font but we do not want to duplicate the same code 

this is a chance for usre to use inheritance 
so we can apply the family property to the body element and the rest of the elements will 
inherit it 

now all the elements on the page are using the same font 

if we want to change the font for a certian heading we can just define a new rule 

## font-weight
this property controls the boldness of the font 
we can add values from 100 - 900 to affect the boldness 
we also have some keywords:
- bold 
- bolder 
- lighter
- normal

bold translates to 700 if we were using the numeric values 
normal translates to 400

## font-style
by default the value for this is normal
but we can set it to italic or bold 

## font-size 
this will affect the size of the font 
we do have keywords but most people like to use numeric values 
which can be relative or absolute 

## color
affects the color of the font 
by default this is set to pure black

generally speaking it is not a good idea to use pure black as 
the body text color its better to use a really dark grey 
like #111 or #222 its a little easier on the eyes
