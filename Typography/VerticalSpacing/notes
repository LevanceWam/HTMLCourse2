This is the notes for VerticalSpacing

now we are going to be looking at styling text 
for this lecture we are going to be looking at vertical spacing 
or the vertical rhythm of our text

##VerticalSpacing
there are 2 properties for vertical spacing 
    - margin 
    - line-height 

so now we are going to duplicate what we have in the body
by doing this we are violating the law of proximity

##law of proximity
this describes how we see connections between various objects 
so objects that are close to each other are precieved to be related

so if we take a look at the margin between the 1st paragraph and the second heading 
it is not clear that this heading is for the paragraph below 
this is where the law of proximity needs to be applied 

so we are going to want to decrease the margin on the bottom and increase the 
one on the top of the 2nd heading 

now we can see the difference this made to the page 
this is a application of the law of proximity

as a rule of thumb we the top margin need to be higher than the bottom argin 
and the reason we are using rem here is becasue we want the margin to be relative to the 
font size of the root element 
so if the default font size is changed the margins are still respected 

##line-height
this is the next property we are going to talk about 
in the body element we are going to specify the line height 

with this property we can adjust the vertical space between lines 
so we can bring the lines closer or farther 
a general rule of thumb is to set this to one and a half times the font-size 

now there is a problem with this approach
so if we change the font size the lines are closeer 
so we have to remember to change the line height if we change the font 

Here is a trick 
if we remove the unit the value set for the line-height property will be used as a multipler 
so the browser will multiply this value by the fontsize
this will keep our font size looking good
