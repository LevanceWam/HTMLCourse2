This is the notes for FontServices

we know embedded fonts now but some of those fonts need to be licensed
licensing can be pretty expensive 
this is where web font services help

## web font services
the most popular is google that gives us access to a bunch of free fonts
- google web fonts (fonts.google.com)
***paid***
- adobe fonts
- fonts.com
- fontdeck.com

all of the services above have a subscription model 
lets learn how to use the google free fonts 

so we go to google fonts and find opensans regular and bold

** one of the limitations of using this service is that 
we can get rid of some of the characters included in the font 
subsettings so we can not reduce the size of the font 

to use the font we need to copy the link and paste them inside of the html markup 
we are going to place them before the stylesheets 

Now what are these?
 - The first link element is with the relationship of pre-connect this tells the browser 
 that the page is going to establish a connection with this domain and retrieve content from 
 there. 
 * this is a tiny optimatization technique to start the process as soon as possible 

 - the second link element is a reference to a stylesheet 
 the service (which is google in this case) is providing a stylesheet for us 

 now we can go inside of the css and use the fonts from google
