This is the notes for EmbeddingWebFonts

so we briefly went over web safe FontServices
in the last lecture 
remember that these fonts are pretty much are on each computer 
out there

but these can be a little boring 
there are plenty of sites that we can use many fonts 

like:
    - fontsquirrel.com
    - fonts.com
    - myfonts.com

some are free and some need to be paided for so we might 
need a license 

generally speaking the paid ones look better at different sizes 
they look very sharp, very clear so 
so if we are working on a serious project we might want to 
to use a paid font 

## Open Sans
this is a popular and free font 
on fontsquirrel.com lets look up open sans 
and download the ttf file 

font files come in a variety of different formats 
- ttf
- otf
- eot
- woff
- woff 2.0

for web we use woff and woff 2.0 
because these formats are more compressed and more efficient for web 
when embedding the fonts for webpages we 
want to make sure that the fonts are really small 
so that they can be downloaded as soon as possible 

so now that we downloaded open sans we are going to convert it to a woff file 
this is because ttf files are pretty big 

back on fontsquirrel we need ton click on generator 
here we can upload a font and convert to a different format 
here we are going to choose optimal 
in the future we will need to look into editting these ourselves

now we need to open the folder that ws downloaded and we can see the new fonts 
some browsers support woff and some of the more modern browsers use woff2
we can find out which browsers use it at 
[caniuse.com]

now we are going to add these fonts into the project
in the css folder add a new file called fonts and insert them in there 

back in the folder we got the files from  
we were also provided with a css
that has a font face rule 

this tells the browser where to find the custom font files 
we are going to copy these rules and paste them at the top of our css 

these need to be at the top because we need to register the fonts first before we can use them 
then we needed to make some small changes

1. first update the urls to find the fonts in the correct folder 
2. in font-face we are going to change the name of the family name 
    to make it easier and readable
3. for the bold version we are going to set the weight to bold since we are referencing the bold version 

Now we can use the fonts anywhere in the code so we are going to add 
'opensans' to the font-family property in the body rule
