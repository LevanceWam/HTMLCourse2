this is the notes for FlashOfUnstyledText

One of the problems with custom text is that the user can ecounter what we call a flash of unstyled text
which basically means while the browser is downloading the font 
it is going to be using a fallback font and appear unstyled 

we can simulate this in the network section in devtools 
by disabling the cache and setting the online setting to slow 3g

now if we reload the page we can see the second font we have in the font stack
appear and after some time the opensans loads
this is what we call  FlashOfUnstyledText (FOUT)

## flash of unstyled text (fout)
during the short peroid of time the text will appear on the site 
now the problem is sometimes when working with more complex pages 
when the new font is applied we might get some layout shifts 
this can move some elements around the page and this can give the user a bad experience 

there is sadly no way around this but there are some techniques to minimize this 
problem but we can not completely aviod this 
this is because we are using a custom font that need to be download on the users computer 

back in the stylesheet we can use the font-display property
to tell the browser how to handle this scenario 

## font display
by default the value is auto and the browser decides what should be done 
unforunately this behavior is different from one browser to another 

so current chrome uses a fallback font then swaps it with the custom font when availiable 
other browsers have different approaches some will hide the text while the text is being downloaded
this is wwhat we call a flash of invisible text 

##swap value 
so we do not want to use auto we want to have a 
explicit control over the behavior 
so we can set it swap so the browser will use a fallback font and then swap when the custom one is availiable

there is still a problem with this 
if th browser takes a while like 10 secs 
the swap will happen and it might cause a layout shift

## fallback value 
a better approach would be to use fallback value
here we are telling the browser to use a fallback font 
this will give the browser a short window to download the font 
if it doesn't make it it will not swap 

##block value 
this is something we do not need to use 
this is going to hide the text and wait for the text to download
but if the text doesn't download then the text will never be visible 

##optional value 
with optional we are telling the browser to 
this font is optional and nice to have its not critical
we are giving the browser a small window to download this 

behind the scenes it will store it in the cache and inbetween page loads the browser is going to 
try to take the font and use it on the page so we do not notice the layout shift
