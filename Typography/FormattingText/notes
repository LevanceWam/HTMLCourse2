- white-space 
    * for controlling wrapping 
- column-properties 
    * create multi-column text 
- direction 
    * which is used in right to left languages 

and plenty more!

##text-align
this property controls the horizontal alignment of our text 
the default value is left 
we should try not to use the justify value this can make the text a little hard to read 

##text-indent
this is used for adding indentation to the first line of text

quite often we don't want to indent the first line after a heading 
we want to indent the line of a subsequent paragraph 
how would we accomplish this?

this is were we would use relational selectors
look to code 

##text-decoration
this property is used for adding underlines or line throughs
we can tset this property to underlines
or to line throughs (this is good for showing prices that are no longer valid)

##text-transform 
With this we can convert the text to lowercase or uppercase or captialize

##whitespace 
this property controls wrapping 
if we set this to nowrap we wont have any wrapping
this is not ideal we would want to truncate the text like adding '...' to the end 

##column-count
In CSS3 we have properties for creating multi column text 
really easily

so using the column count property
this will create columns

column gap controls the gap
column-rule adds a line 

##direction
this is used in right to left languages
default is ltr: left to right
