This is the notes for HorizontalSpacing

now we are going to look into HorizontalSpacing

##HorizontalSpacing
in this lesson we are going to talk about 3 properties 
    - letter-spacing
    - word-spacing
    - width 

in the rule for the body element we are going to 
use the letter-spacing property

##letter-spacing 
this property allows us to control the space between letters in a text
when using this property we do not want to use rems 
this is because this is going to give us a lot of space 

it would be better to use px here 

we use this property if the font makes the text to close to each other and we 
want to give our text a little more space 
the same can be applied of the letters are too far

##word-spacing 
this property helps us specify the spacing between words 

We are going to comment out the 2 properties that we just used 
so we can look at the ideal line length

##Ideal line-length
now we are going to talk about how many characters should we have in each line 
so the user can easily read our text 

research shows that:
    - should be between 50 - 70 characters

so how can we achieve this?
there is a trick for this 
so we need to define a rule for paragraph 
we are going to set the width of this element to 50ch 
ch is another unit in css which is relative to the width 
of the 0 characters so this 50ch is equalivent to 50 0's
