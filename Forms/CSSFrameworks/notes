This is the notes for CSSFrameworks

what we lerned in the previous section is that styling a form can be 
a bit time consuming  this is where a lot of people use CSSFrameworks

## Framework
A Framework is essentially a library of css code  that we can 
reuse to build modern looking websites 
there are plenty of frameworks out there like 
    - bootstrap (most popular)
    - foundation
    - semantic UI
    - UI kit 
    - materialize 
    - miligram
and plenty more 

frameworks comes with a lot of code that needs to be downloaded to the users computer 
this is one of the reasons people dont like to use them 

in this lecture we are going to look at the differences of bootstrap and milligram 
and from here on we are going to be using milligram in the lectures 

first we need to head to: https://getbootstrap.com/
hit the download button and we are going to use the 
cdn (content delivery network)
cdn are a bunch of servers around the world optimized for delivering js files images and so on 

we are going to copy the link and paste it under our css 
remove any previous styles that might be there 

we are going to need to nevigate to the docs and look at how to use bootstrap
all we have to do is apply classes to the elements
