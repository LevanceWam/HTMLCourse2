This is the notes for RadioButtons

With check boxes the user can select multiple items 
but sometimes we want to limit them to a single item 
for this we can use a radio buttons or a drop down list
in this demo we are going to be looking at a radio button 

to implement this we set the input type to radio
the name attribute for this input is used to 
for grouping mutliple radio buttons 

so now that we have 2 radio buttons in the same group we can only select one of the buttons 

we can also preselect a radio button by using "checked"
