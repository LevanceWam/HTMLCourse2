This is the notes for StylingForms

Now we are  going to add some rules to the form 

##form style
first we are going to take the input field and put it under its label
we can do this by changing the display to
block 
this will move the  input field under the label 
this is because block elements take up the entire width of the page 

There is a problem here though we are violationg the 
law of proximity, this law states that humans see things close together as connected

since we have the form controls in divs we are going to 
give them a class and add some margin

## input field styles

we have to be careful when applying rules to the 
input element because this affects all inputs regardless of type
so this is a good time to use the attribute selector

now we are going to want to target the focus on the input element 
but when we do it the normal way using the :focus psuedo selector nothing happens 
this is because the border that is set by default on chrome and other browsers are being displayed 

to stop this set the outline property tpo 0

now we are going to add a box shadow to make it look more readable 

##buttons
