This is the notes for drop down list 

In this demo we are going to be working with
DropdownList

##select element
inside of this element we can have multiple option elements
this is used the same way we used it in the data list lecture 

we are going to leave the first option blank because
we are going to make this list optional the user does not have 
to select a value

now there are times we are going to want to select an option by default 
like if the user choose a course previously and we loaded that 
to so this we add the selected attribute to the option 
this is a boolean attribute  

We can allow the user to select multiple options 
so on the select opening tag we add the multiple attribute this is another 
boolean attribute 

##optgroup
this is the option group element this allows us to catergories our options
