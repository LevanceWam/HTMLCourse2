This is the notes for SubmittingForms

now lets see how to submit a form!

lets say we aare going to build a contact form with a name and 
email

** note **

there are to ways to make a button 
    - using the button element 
    - using the input type submit 

the difference is that using the input we can not use a icon
but the button element will let us 

##submitting the form
there are 2 attributes that we need to know 

    - action
        * this is where we are going to send the data 
        so we need to type a relative or absolute url 
        
        this is where server side techology come into the picture 

    ## server-side technology
    there are plenty of server side technologies out there like 
        - node/express
        - django 
        - ASP.NET
        - Laravel
        - Ruby on Rails 

    the server we use depends on the language that we use 
    to keep things simple we are going to use formspree
    https://formspree.io/f/xgepgeee
    the backend is built for us so all we have to do is copy the url and put it in the action

    - method
        * this is the second attribute 
        the value for this can be either GET or POST 

        * when we use POST the current fields and their values will be included in the 
        body of the request 

        * when we use GET the fields will not be include in the body of the request 
        instead they are going to be appended to the target url 
        this method is used when we want to bookmark the url so we can always come back to it 
        an example of this is google

each input field needs to have a name attribute
once they are there we can submit something on the form 
we can look at formspree and see the submission
and we can see it to the email connected

formspree makes things easier we don't have to build the back end and 
we can intergate with different services
