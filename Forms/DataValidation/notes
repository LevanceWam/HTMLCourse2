This is the notes for DataValidation

before we submit a form we should always validate the data 
and make sure it is in the right shape 

some examples are:
    - Required fields
        * this is to make sure the field is filled out
    - emails
        * make sure that they are valid
    - numbers 
    - dates

a lot of hackers like to provide invalid values to see if they can break anything 
they can enter a negative value for the age or a long string for the value 

##Html5 elements
now html 5 elements come with built in validation 
so we can perform basic checks but for more advance stuff we need to use javascript
so lets take a look at the built in  validation 

for the text input  and add the boolean attribute required 
to make the field required

minlength and maxlength are explaintory 

##email validation

for email types we can use the attributes above and 
it also checks to see if we follow the email format

## dates
for date it checks to make sure we have a valid date 

##numbers
numbers use min and max instead of minlength and maxlength
