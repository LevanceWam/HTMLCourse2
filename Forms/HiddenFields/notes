This is the notes for HiddenFields

Lets say we have a form that edits a course 
the question we need to ask ourselves is how does the server
know what course we editted?

well each course should have a unqiue identifer which is often a numeric value 
the id's are generated by the server 

when we are displaying this form we want to include the identifer
not the id of the course 
this is done so the server can keep track of the course that was added 

this is where hidden fields come in 

so in the html we are going to want to define a input with the type of hidden 
the user will not be able to see this field because it is hidden
but when we submitt this form to the server the data that was included in this field in this case 
will be posteds to the server 

Here is a tip!
just because the field is hidden doesn't mean we can not find the information 
so be sure not to put sensitive data here 

so we can look at the source code to see this
