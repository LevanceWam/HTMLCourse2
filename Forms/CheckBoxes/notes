this is the notes for CheckBoxes

in this demo we are going to be working with check boxes 

so first we make a input element and set its type to check box
with check boxes the label needs to come right after it

we are going to but these elements in a container together so they can 
be stacked vertically  

to have a check box checked by default we need to use the boolean attribute 
"checked"
