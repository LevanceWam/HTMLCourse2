This is the notes for DataList

lets implement a suggestion list in html
we want a list of suggestions after we start typing in the input field 
so first we need to define a data list 

##datalist element
inside of the list we are going to add a bunch of options 
so for this demo we are going to use countries 

now we want to associate the data list with the input field
first we need to give it a unique identifer or id 

then we need to use the list attribute to connect the input to the list 

now in the browser when we focus on the list we can see that list of items 
a lot of people are not familiar with this 
they reach out to 3rd parties for this 

the user can still type other values that are not on the list 
to stop them from doing just that we use a dropdown list 

##values
now when we choose something from the list we want to send a numeric value to the server 
this can help us know what value was selected by the user say if we are using a database 

by using data-value attribute this is a custom attribute 
we can use this with javascript we can read the value of this attribute and submit it to the server
