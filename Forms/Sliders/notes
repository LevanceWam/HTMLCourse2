This is the notes for Sliders

there are times we are going to want to show the user a numeric value with a slider 

to do this we define a input with the type of range
for this input we do not need the name attribute 

the attributes we do use are;
    - min
    - max
    - value

now to show the value we can not do that with plain HTML and CSS 
we need javascript

all we would have to do is listen to the current changes in the value of the slider 
then we can read the current value and display it somewhere else in a label 

this is a cool test to try on our own
