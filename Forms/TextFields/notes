This is the notes for TextField

in this lesson we are going to take a look at text fields 
so we created a simple form with a input field of text 
since we are using milligram the text box is taking up whole
screen 

we can apply a a style to our form element and give it a width 
and padding so we can see the input better  

##different types of input 

if we change the type to:
    - number 
        * the input field will only accept numbers and 
        will have a little buttons for changing the values 
        
        *this is benefical for mobile and tablets the keyboard
        that comes up will only show numbers
    
    - password
        * whatever is typed in the field will be masked 

    - date
        * since we are using milligram we get a calender icon when clicked on 
        pulls up a calendar

    - email
        * same as before only able to type a valid email

    - textarea (its it own element )
        * for being able to type more than one line in a text field

        * the attribute cols is for the amount of characters in a line 
        rows is the number of lines


here is a list of more input types

## input attributes 

input has a couple of attributes we need to be aware of:

    - value 
        * this is used to prepopulate a input field 
    
    - placeholder 
        * when the input field is empty we see a label in the input field
        but when we type in it, it disappears
    
    - readonly
        * can not change the value inside of the field

    - disable 
        * can not select the fields and the when form is submitted this value will not be submitted 

    - maxlength and minlength
        * validation purposes

    - autofocus
        * this is a boolean attribute this does not need a value 
        when the page loads this input will automatically be focused 

with textarea we share the same attributes expect for value 
so inorder to prepopulate it we type inbetween the tags
