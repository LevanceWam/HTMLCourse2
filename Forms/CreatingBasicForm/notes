This is the notes for CreatingBasicForm

We are going to be looking into creating a form
we start off by using the form element 

## Form element 
every form should have an action attribute this is used for submitting the form
we are going to get rid of it for now

inside the form element we are going to have 1 or more input fields
also known as form controls 

## input 
each input element has a type 
so we can set it to text, radio and so on

Each input needs a Label 
some people would use a paragraph element but there is a better element for this 

##label element 
this element is what we use to label a input and this is a inline element 
so it will appear next to the input horizontally 

all label element have a for attribute with this attribute we can associate this label with it a input field 
so the input field would need a unqiue identifer  and then we use the value for the for in label 
once we do this if we click on the label the input associated with the label will focus 

labels makes our forms more accessible or more users

##Email type 
another input type is email, this comes with some basic validation so if 
the value is not a email then it will return a error 

##layout
if we want to change the form layout to vertical 
then we need to put it in a container like a div, ul, or p element 
this will have it looking vertical 

##button
now we are going to add a submit button 
we add a button element, this element has a type 

if we set it to submit  then it will be used for submitting the form 

reset will clear all of the values in the form
