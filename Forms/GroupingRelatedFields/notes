this is the notes for GroupingRelatedFields

As our forms get more and more complex we need to group
these related fields into logical containers 
this is where we use the fieldset element 

so in the fieldset element we need to add the legend element this is the label for the group

now in this section we can have one or more input groups

now some people like to use the section element and the h2 element instead
this is also another way of doing things
